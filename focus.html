            <h2 class="section-title">What can we Focus on</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rare Genetic Disorders:</strong>Gene therapy holds significant promise for treating rare genetic diseases, many of which have no effective treatments currently available. Research and development efforts are focused on developing gene therapy approaches to address these conditions and improve patients' quality of life.</li>
             </ul>
<ul>			 
			   <li><strong>Cancer Treatment: </strong> Gene therapy is being explored as a potential treatment for various types of cancer. Researchers are investigating ways to modify patients' immune cells to better recognize and attack cancer cells, as well as directly targeting cancer cells with gene-based therapies to induce cell death or inhibit tumor growth.</li>
               </ul>
<ul>			   
				<li><strong>Inherited Genetic Disorders:</strong>  Inherited genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and sickle cell anemia, are also a key focus area for gene therapy. Efforts are underway to develop gene therapy approaches that can correct the underlying genetic mutations responsible for these disorders, potentially offering long-term therapeutic benefits.</li>
                </ul>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Neurological Disorders:</strong> Gene therapy holds promise for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Research in this area is focused on developing gene therapy strategies to deliver therapeutic genes to the brain and correct underlying genetic abnormalities associated with these disorders.</li>
                </ul>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Infectious Diseases: </strong> Gene therapy is being explored as a potential treatment for infectious diseases, including viral infections such as HIV/AIDS and genetic disorders such as hemophilia. Efforts are focused on developing gene therapy approaches to enhance patients' immune responses to infections or to directly target and inhibit the replication of infectious agents.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Precision Medicine:</strong> Gene therapy is a key component of precision medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatments to individual patients based on their unique genetic makeup. Research in this area is focused on developing personalized gene therapy approaches that take into account patients' genetic variability and disease characteristics to optimize treatment outcomes.</li>
