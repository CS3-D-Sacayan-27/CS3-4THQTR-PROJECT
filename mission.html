            <p>Gene therapy aims to treat or prevent diseases by modifying the genetic material within a patient's cells.</p>
            <p>Its primary mission is to correct defective genes responsible for disease development, thereby offering a potentially permanent cure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gene therapy aims to correct defective genes responsible for disease development, potentially offering a permanent cure.</li>
                <li>By modifying genetic material, gene therapy seeks to prevent the onset of genetic disorders and other diseases.</li>
                <li>The approach can be applied to a wide range of conditions, including genetic disorders, certain cancers, and viral infections.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By introducing, removing, or altering genetic material, gene therapy strives to restore normal function to cells and tissues. The mission encompasses advancing scientific understanding of gene functions and interactions to improve therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <li><strong>Targeting Various Conditions:</strong>The approach can be applied to a wide range of conditions, including genetic disorders, certain cancers, and viral infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Restoring Normal Function: </strong> The mission includes introducing, removing, or altering genetic material to restore normal cellular and tissue function.</li>
                <li><strong>Advancing Scientific Understanding:</strong> Gene therapy seeks to enhance knowledge of gene functions and interactions to improve therapeutic strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing Safe Delivery Systems:</strong> A crucial aspect is developing safe and effective delivery systems to transport genetic material into targeted cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimizing Side Effects: </strong> The mission includes efforts to minimize side effects and ensure the long-term efficacy of gene therapy treatments.</li>
				<li><strong>Ensuring Patient Safety:</strong> Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies focus on overcoming challenges and ensuring patient safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life:</strong> Gene therapy aspires to improve patients' quality of life by providing innovative and personalized medical solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mainstream and Accessible Treatment:</strong> The ultimate goal is to make gene therapy a mainstream and accessible treatment option through continuous research and clinical trials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This graphic depicts the two major types of gene therapy. The illustration on the left shows ex vivo gene therapy, where the cells are modified outside the body and then are delivered back to the patient. The illustration on the right shows in vivo gene therapy, where the genetic modification of the cell takes place inside the body.</p>
            <p>Gene therapy products are biological products regulated by the FDAâ€™s Center for Biologics Evaluation
